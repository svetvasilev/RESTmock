# RESTmock
Inplace mocking of REST services for improved testability of your code

# What does it do?
Helps developers to test their code that consumes REST services in a more convenient way, right from their developer environment.
There are currently tons of online tools that allow you to create mocks of REST services consumed by your code. However they often require additional setup through an UI that is not that flexible which quickly forces the developres to write some script like code to achieve the desired behavior.
RESTmock allows you to quickly define and spin mocks of the REST services you consume in a unit test project, part of the same solution where your code resides. In-place with the .NET language of your choice.
